# Tutorial

Here is a quick tutorial to get you started. We assume you have [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and `GLMakie.jl` (or one of the other backends) installed already.

First, we import GLMakie, which might take a little bit of time because there is a lot to precompile. Just sit tight!
For this tutorial, we also call `AbstractPlotting.inline!(true)` so plots appear inline after each example.
Otherwise, an interactive window will open when you return a `Figure`.

```@example 1
using GLMakie
AbstractPlotting.inline!(true)
nothing # hide
```

!!! note
    A `Figure` is usually displayed whenever it is returned in global scope (e.g. in the REPL).
    To display a Figure from within a local scope,
    like from within a function, you can directly call `display(figure)`.  

## A first plot

Let's begin by plotting some points using the `scatter` function.


```@example 1
points = [Point2f0(cos(t), sin(t)) for t in LinRange(0, 2pi, 20)]
colors = 1:20
figure, axis, scatterobject = scatter(points, color = colors, markersize = 15)
figure
```

You can see that we've split the return value of `scatter` into three components: `figure`, `axis` and `scatterobject`.
Every plotting function in its default form returns an object of type `FigureAxisPlot` which bundles these three parts, which makes it easy to continue working separately with them.

## Changing Attributes

One great feature of Makie is that it uses `Observables` (or `Nodes` as a Makie-specific alias),
which make it easy to write visualizations that can be updated dynamically with new data.

An `Observable` is a container object which notifies all its listeners whenever its content changes.
Put simply, using `Observables`, if your input data changes your plots change as well.

Plot objects usually have a collection of attributes, which are observables. If you change them,
the plots update immediately.
Let's try to change the marker size of our scatter plot:

```@example 1
scatterobject.markersize = 30
figure
```


## Adding A Plot

Let's add another scatter plot to our axis.
To add a plot to an existing figure or axis, you use the mutating version with a `!`.
Each plot type such as `Scatter` has a non-mutating function (`scatter`) and a mutating function (`scatter!`) associated with it.

Let's plot another circle.
This time we try some different arguments, a circle function and a range of values.

We use `scatter!` without passing a specific target as the first argument, which plots into the last used axis.

```@example 1
circlefunc = ts -> 1.5 .* Point2f0.(cos.(ts), sin.(ts))
scatter!(circlefunc, LinRange(0, 2pi, 30), color = :red)
figure
```

## Plotting `Observables`

So far, we have plotted normal "static" values - a simple array of points, or a function evaluated on static values.
Makie makes it really easy to plot "dynamic" values as well.
This is done using Observables.

Imagine that you want to interactively visualize how a sine function over a constant interval depends on its parameters.
That means the x values are fixed but the y values depend on the frequency and phase of the sine function.
Such a dependency is easy to express with `Observables` or `Nodes` for short.

Usually, all plot functions accept their input arguments and attributes as `Observables`.
If you don't pass `Observables`, they get converted internally anyway.

```@example 1
xs = -pi:0.01:pi
frequency = Node(3.0) # Node === Observable
phase = Node(0.0)

ys = lift(frequency, phase) do fr, ph
    @. 0.3 * sin(fr * xs - ph)
end

lines!(xs, ys, color = :blue, linewidth = 3)
figure
```

You can see that our sine function was nicely visualized. The `lift` function takes as its first
input a function which computes its output from the other arguments, `frequency` and `phase`
in this case, which are `Observables`.
The output is then stored inside another `Observable`, `ys`.
Therefore, `ys` always contains the result of the sine function
with the current `frequency` and `phase` applied
to the values in `xs`. (If you haven't used the `do` syntax before, it is Julia's way of passing
an anonymous function as the first argument to another function.
It's very useful for dealing with `Observables`.)

!!! note
    For short functions, there is a really convenient macro alternative to `lift`.
    Instead of what we wrote above, we could have written `ys = @lift(0.3 * sin($frequency .* xs .- $phase))`.
    Just prefix expressions that reference observables with a `$` symbol.

Now, we can change the `frequency` to a different value and the plot will change with it.
`Observables` are mutated with empty square brackets (like `Ref`s).

```@example 1
frequency[] = 9
figure
```

You see that the line plot has changed to reflect the new frequency.
That's how easy it is to create a dynamic visualization with `Observables`. 
Imagine the opportunities to hook Observables up with sliders and buttons to control a complex plot.


## Saving Static Plots

Makie overloads the `FileIO` interface. This is how you save this figure as a `png`:

```julia
save("sineplot.png", figure)
```

!!! note
    Different backends have different possible output formats. `GLMakie` as a GPU-powered backend can
    only output bitmaps like `png`. `CairoMakie` can output high-quality vector graphics such as `svg` and
    `pdf`, on the other hand those formats don't work as well (or at all) with 3D content.

See [Output](@ref) for more information on this.

## Creating Animations

Often, we want to create small videos that show how a visualization changes over time.
This is really easy to do if we already have a plot with observables.
Once we have our figure, we can just change the observables that we want in a closure function and
pass that to `record`, which creates a video for us.

We can just re-use our existing figure. Let's change the phase over time.
We just need to supply an iterator with as many elements as we want frames in our video.

```@example 1
framerate = 30 # fps
timestamps = 0:1/framerate:3

record(figure, "phase_animation.mp4", timestamps; framerate = framerate) do t
    phase[] = 2 * t * 2pi
end
nothing # hide
```

And here is our result, as we expect the sine function moves sideways.

![phase_animation](phase_animation.mp4)

For more information, see the [Animations](@ref) and the [Observables & Interaction](@ref) sections.

## Summary

That concludes our short tutorial. We hope you have learned how to create basic plots
with Makie and how easy it is to change and animate them using Observables.

You can check out more examples that you can adapt
in the [Example Gallery](http://juliaplots.org/MakieReferenceImages/gallery/index.html).
