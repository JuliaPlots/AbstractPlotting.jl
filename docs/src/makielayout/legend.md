# Legend

## Creating A Legend From Elements

You can create a basic Legend by passing a vector of legend entries and a vector of labels, plus an optional title as the third argument.

The elements in the vector of legend entries can either be plot objects or LegendElements like LineElement, MarkerElement and PolyElement.
Or they can be vectors of such objects that will be layered together as one.

```@example
using CairoMakie

f = Figure()

Axis(f[1, 1])

xs = 0:0.5:10
ys = sin.(xs)
lin = lines!(xs, ys, color = :blue)
sca = scatter!(xs, ys, color = :red, markersize = 15)

Legend(f[1, 2], [lin, sca, [lin, sca]], ["a line", "some dots", "both together"])

f
```

## Creating A Legend From An Axis

You can also create a Legend by passing it an axis object, like `Axis`, `LScene` or `Scene`.
All plots that have a `label` attribute set will be put into the legend, in the order that they appear in the axis, and you can optionally pass a title as the third argument.

```@example
using CairoMakie

f = Figure()

ax = f[1, 1] = Axis(f)

lines!(0..15, sin, label = "sin", color = :blue)
lines!(0..15, cos, label = "cos", color = :red)
lines!(0..15, x -> -cos(x), label = "-cos", color = :green)

f[1, 2] = Legend(f, ax, "Trig Functions", framevisible = false)

f
```


## Multi-Bank Legend

You can control the number of banks with the `nbanks` attribute. Banks are columns
when in vertical mode, and rows when in horizontal mode.

```@example
using CairoMakie

f = Figure()

Axis(f[1, 1])

xs = 0:0.1:10
lins = [lines!(xs, sin.(xs .+ 3v), color = RGBf0(v, 0, 1-v)) for v in 0:0.1:1]

Legend(f[1, 2], lins, string.(1:length(lins)), nbanks = 3)

f
```


## Legend Inside An Axis

The `axislegend` function is a quick way to add a legend to an Axis.
You can pass a selected axis plus arguments which are forwarded to the `Legend` constructor, or the current axis is used by default.
If you pass only a string, it's used as the title with the current axis.

The position can be set via a shortcut symbol, first halign (l, r, c) then valign (b, t, c), such as :lt for left, top and :cb for center bottom.

```@example
using CairoMakie

f = Figure()

ax = Axis(f[1, 1])

sc1 = scatter!(randn(10, 2), color = :red, label = "Red Dots")
sc2 = scatter!(randn(10, 2), color = :blue, label = "Blue Dots")
scatter!(randn(10, 2), color = :orange, label = "Orange Dots")
scatter!(randn(10, 2), color = :cyan, label = "Cyan Dots")

axislegend()

axislegend("Titled Legend", position = :lb)

axislegend(ax, [sc1, sc2], ["One", "Two"], "Selected Dots", position = :rb,
    orientation = :horizontal)

f
```


Alternatively, you can simply add a Legend to the same layout slot
that an axis lives in. As long as the axis is bigger than the legend you can
set the legend's `tellheight` and `tellwidth` to `false` and position it using the align
variables. You can use the margin keyword to keep the legend from touching the axis
spines.

```@example
using CairoMakie

haligns = [:left, :right, :center]
valigns = [:top, :bottom, :center]

f = Figure()

Axis(f[1, 1])

xs = 0:0.1:10
lins = [lines!(xs, sin.(xs .* i), color = color)
    for (i, color) in zip(1:3, [:red, :blue, :green])]

for (j, ha, va) in zip(1:3, haligns, valigns)
    Legend(
        f[1, 1], lins, ["Line $i" for i in 1:3],
        "$ha & $va",
        tellheight = false,
        tellwidth = false,
        margin = (10, 10, 10, 10),
        halign = ha, valign = va, orientation = :horizontal
    ) 
end

f
```


## Creating Legend Entries Manually

Sometimes you might want to construct legend entries from scratch to have maximum
control. So far you can use `LineElement`s, `MarkerElement`s or `PolyElement`s.
Some attributes that can't have a meaningful preset and would usually be inherited
from plot objects (like color) have to be explicitly specified. Others are
inherited from the legend if they are not specified. These include marker
arrangement for `MarkerElement`s or poly shape for `PolyElement`s. You can check
the list using this function:

```@example
using AbstractPlotting
MakieLayout.attributenames(LegendEntry)
```


```@example
using CairoMakie

f = Figure()

Axis(f[1, 1])


elem_1 = [LineElement(color = :red, linestyle = nothing),
          MarkerElement(color = :blue, marker = 'x', strokecolor = :black)]

elem_2 = [PolyElement(color = :red, strokecolor = :blue),
          LineElement(color = :black, linestyle = :dash)]

elem_3 = LineElement(color = :green, linestyle = nothing,
        linepoints = Point2f0[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)])

elem_4 = MarkerElement(color = :blue, marker = 'Ï€',
        strokecolor = :transparent,
        markerpoints = Point2f0[(0.2, 0.2), (0.5, 0.8), (0.8, 0.2)])

elem_5 = PolyElement(color = :green, strokecolor = :black,
        polypoints = Point2f0[(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1)])


Legend(f[1, 2],
    [elem_1, elem_2, elem_3, elem_4, elem_5],
    ["Line & Marker", "Poly & Line", "Line", "Marker", "Poly"],
    patchsize = (35, 35), rowgap = 10)

f
```


## Horizontal Legend

In case you want the legend entries to be listed horizontally, set the `orientation`
attribute to `:horizontal`. In this case the `nbanks` attribute refers to the
number of rows instead of columns. To keep an adjacent axis from potentially shrinking to
the width of the horizontal legend, set `tellwidth = false` and `tellheight = true`
if you place the legend below or above the axis.



```@example
using CairoMakie

f = Figure()

Axis(f[1, 1])

xs = 0:0.5:10
ys = sin.(xs)
lin = lines!(xs, ys, color = :blue)
sca = scatter!(xs, ys, color = :red, markersize = 15)

Legend(f[1, 2], [lin, sca, lin], ["a line", "some dots", "line again"])

Legend(f[2, 1], [lin, sca, lin], ["a line", "some dots", "line again"],
    orientation = :horizontal, tellwidth = false, tellheight = true)

f
```


## Multi-Group Legends

Sometimes a legend consists of multiple groups, for example in a plot where both
marker size and color are varied and those properties need to be visualized
separately, but still together in one legend. Each group's content is given as
an array of elements and an array of labels, each within one collective array.
You can shift the position of the titles relative to each group with the
`titleposition` attribute, either `:left` or `:top`.

```@example
using CairoMakie

f = Figure()

Axis(f[1, 1])

markersizes = [5, 10, 15, 20]
colors = [:red, :green, :blue, :orange]

for ms in markersizes, color in colors
    scatter!(randn(5, 2), markersize = ms, color = color)
end

group_size = [MarkerElement(marker = :circle, color = :black, strokecolor = :transparent,
    markersize = ms) for ms in markersizes]

group_color = [PolyElement(color = color, strokecolor = :transparent)
    for color in colors]

legends = [Legend(f,
    [group_size, group_color],
    [string.(markersizes), string.(colors)],
    ["Size", "Color"]) for _ in 1:6]

f[1, 2:4] = legends[1:3]
f[2:4, 2] = legends[4:6]

for l in legends[4:6]
    l.orientation = :horizontal
    l.tellheight = true
    l.tellwidth = false
end

legends[2].titleposition = :left
legends[5].titleposition = :left

legends[3].nbanks = 2
legends[5].nbanks = 2
legends[6].nbanks = 2

f
```
