# Layoutables

!!! note
    All examples in this section are presented as static CairoMakie vector graphics for clarity of visuals
    Keep in mind that CairoMakie is not interactive.
    Use GLMakie for interactive widgets, as WGLMakie currently doesn't have picking implemented.


## Deleting Layoutables

To remove layoutables from their layout and the figure or scene, use `delete!(layoutable)`.
