# Reflection

Since objects with links (as explained in [Interaction](@ref)) to each other,
all animatable etc, a plot object can become fairly complex.
To work against this, there is a rich reflection api, allowing you to look into the scene tree,
display what objects are linked and interactively change the attributes.
